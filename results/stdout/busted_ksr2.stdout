Analysis Description
--------------------
BUSTED (branch-site unrestricted statistical test of episodic
diversification) uses a random effects branch-site model fitted jointly
to all or a subset of tree branches in order to test for alignment-wide
evidence of episodic diversifying selection. Assuming there is evidence
of positive selection (i.e. there is an omega > 1), BUSTED will also
perform a quick evidence-ratio style analysis to explore which
individual sites may have been subject to selection.

### Obtaining initial branch lengths under the GTR model
Log(L) = -5768.008751385815

### Fitting the unconstrained branch-site model
Log(L) = -5319.672674007421. Unrestricted class omega = 108.9956849115568 (weight = 0.0003792961349278528)

### Fitting the branch-site model that disallows omega > 1 among foreground branches
